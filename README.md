This is a very simple example of how to use the Delcom USB indicator.
It is a simple console program that waits for a key. If you press space.
it causes the light to flash blue for 20 seconds.  If you press any other key,
it exits.  

BlueFlasher/Program.cs is the main entry point. It includes some commented out
code that shows you how to get the light to do everything possible.

This program relies on the DelcomSupport project I whacked up years ago
based on some sample code from Delcom.
